# Basic-wave-signal-processing
before you start audio signal processing you need to know fundamental knowledge of how it creates and how you can visualized every single part of your process. So in this example I created a wave audio file with a specific sine signal and saved it. After that I added a noise to this specific signal and then you can see how we clean the noise from this signal.<br /> 
In the next section we create two random signals (you can hear this awsome audio ;) in test1) and then we implement fourier transform on summation of these two signals to be capable of recovering the amplitude of this wave signal.<br />
At the end of this example we read a recorded audio with python and do all mentioned process on this signal.<br /><br />
Hope you enjoy...
